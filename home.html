<p>Now that we know who a teacher is, what kind of teacher should we aspire to be?</p>

<ol>
<li>Good teachers are strong communicators</li>
<li>Good teachers listen well</li>
<li>Good teachers focus on collaboration</li>
<li>Good teachers are adaptable</li>
<li>Good teachers are engaging</li>
<li>Good teachers show empathy</li>
<li>Good teachers have patience</li>
<li>Good teachers value real-world learning</li>
<li>Good teachers share best practices</li>
<li>Good teachers are lifelong learners</li>
</ol>

<p>So what? Teachers can be all this. And so why this website? It has nothing to do with making good teachers!</p>

<p>Let us look at this again. Our site is to help organise teaching resources so that teachers spend more time being teachers and giving their best to the learners. We believe that sharing our stories, experiences we shall grow the field of education in leaps and bounds! Join us in sharing this journey together!</p>
