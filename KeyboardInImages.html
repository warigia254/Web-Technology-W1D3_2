					<h1>The Computer Keyboard through the ages in images</h1> 
					<p>Have you ever wondered how the keyboards of the day 					looked like? You may have heard of stories about the 					typewriters where you had to be careful with your pinkie 					finger. Welcome to our journey today as we look at the 							evolution of the computer keyboard.</p>
					
					<p>This piece of work is done under the guidance of 							the Power Learn Project. </p>

  <figcaption><h3>1. IBM Model M Keyboard</h3></figcaption> 
<p>Decades after its introduction in the mid-'80s, IBM's classic Model M remains a favourite for keyboard purists.</p>

  <figcaption><h3>2. IBM Selectric Typewriter</h3></figcaption><p>Introduced in 1961, the IBM Selectric electric typewriter was an enormous influence on the modern computer keyboard. Many grew to love the feel of Selectric's keyboard, so many early computer keyboards minicked it.</p>

  <img src="03 Reed-Switch Keyboard.png" alt="Reed-Switch Keyboard" style="width:40%">
  <figcaption><h3>3. Reed-Switch Keyboard</h3></figcaption><p>This is an early '70s computer keyboard design that incorporated reed switches which work with a magnet and two metal filaments. When the magnetic field gets close enough, it pulls the filaments together to complete the circuit generating an electrical signal for the desired character to type.</p>

  <figcaption><h3>4. Capacitative-Switch Keyboard</h3></figcaption><p>Keen to get away from the unreliable reed switches, Key Tronic developed the capacitative switch in the late '70s. It worked by putting a little bit of aluminum under the key top. When the key was depressed, the foil changed the capacitance of the circuit board underneath and a microprocessor registered a keystroke.</p>

  <img src="05 Buckling-Spring Keyboard.png" alt="Buckling-Spring Keyboard" style="width:40%">
  <figcaption><h3>5. Buckling-Spring Keyboard</h3></figcaption><p>In 1978, IBM received a patent for a "buckling spring" key mechanism that mimicked the feel of the old Selectrics. The mechanism worked with a small sprint attached to non-parallel surfaces under the keycap.

The spring coiled normally when depressed but "buckled" to the side at the snap point due to the non-parallel surfaces of the attachment and created the familir click-clack sound of IBM's popular Model M keyboard and other old keyboards. The buckled portion of the sprint activated the circuit, which generated the keystroke.</p>

  <img src="06 Rubber-Dome Keyboards.png" alt="Rubber-Dome Keyboard" style="width:40%">
  <figcaption><h3>6. Rubber-Dome Keyboard</h3></figcaption> <p>Rubber dome-based keys, which work with the same snapping principle as a toilet plunger, came to prominence in the late '80s and early '90s and are found in many of today's standard desktop keyboards. The key caps push down on the domes, which collapse, closing circuits and recording keystrokes, and then snap back.(This keyboard is shown upside down.)</p>

  <img src="07 Scissor Switches.png" alt="Scissor Switches Keyboard" style="width:40%">
  <figcaption><h3>7. Scissor Switches Keyboard</h3></figcaption><p>Scissor-switch keyboards also have rubber domes but use scissoring mechanism attached to the key tops to push down the domes. The mechanism, typically found in laptops and thin keyboards, shortens the distance a key must travel to record a stroke, which allows the keys themselves to be shorter.</p>

  <figcaption><h3>8. Ultrabook Keyboard</h3></figcaption><p>As laptops grow ever more svelte, manufacturers are constantly trying to cut costs and make the keyboard smaller without sacrificing users' comfort. The Vizio Thin and Light shown here is one of the striving for a comfortable, responsive keyboard in an ultraslim profile. This is no easy task. Laptop makers must weigh ergonomic factors against dimensions, weight, cost and other practical design considerations.</p>
